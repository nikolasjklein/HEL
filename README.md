INTRODUCTION
------------

HEL is a DOOM93-like FPS with RPG progression element, resource management and inventory with maybe some Darksouls-like mechanics when you die. Maybe.

In HEL, you either play as Olof, a norse warrior or Fae a shield maiden. Our protagonist will have to hack his way through hordes of enemies and prevent Ragnarok.

What seems to be a normal clan war clans turns to be way more than that. Through its progression on Midgard, the land of the humans, fighting other viking clans our protagonist will quickly become the center of interest in what seems to be a journey to prevent Ragnarok.

Using everything at its disposition, our protagonist will travel through different portals going to all nine norse worlds ending in a fight against Hel and her army on her ship, Naglfar.
